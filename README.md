## Create a React Vite Application

1. Create a new Vite project.

   ```
   npm create vite@latest
   ```

3. Run your project.

   ```
   cd my-app
   ```
   ```
   npm install
   ```
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

   This will start a development server on port 5173. You can open your browser and go to `http://localhost:5173` to see your application.
